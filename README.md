# URL Shortener Project

This is a basic URL shortener project created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the URL shortener page.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the URL shortener page.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for handling the URL shortening logic.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
2. Enter the original URL in the input field.
3. Click the "Shorten" button to get a simulated short URL.
4. The short URL will be displayed on the page.

**Note:** This is a simple example that uses client-side JavaScript for demonstration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need a server-side application to handle URL shortening securely.

## About the Shortening Logic

The URL shortening logic in `script.js` is a basic simulation. In a production environment, you would implement a secure and unique shortening algorithm on the server-side.
